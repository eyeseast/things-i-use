# Things I use for ...



## Languages

Python 3: The first language I learned and still my favorite for anything not in a browser (with a few small exceptions). I try to start everything in Python 3 unless there's a really good reason not to.

Javascript (ES6+): I'm still surprised how much arrow functions, spread operators and deconstruction have sped up my JS coding.
