# Things I use for ...

## Languages

[Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/): The first language I learned and still my favorite for anything not in a browser (with a few small exceptions). I try to start everything in Python 3 unless there's a really good reason not to.

[ES6+](https://github.com/yosuke-furukawa/tower-of-babel): I'm still surprised how much arrow functions, spread operators and deconstruction have sped up my JS coding.

[Go](https://golang.org/): I use it for work and it has grown on me. Type checking is something I want in most things, now.

## Frontend framework

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): It's a joy to code with and easy to wrap my head around.

## Server-side

[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/): More and more, I'm building Sapper apps, even for small stuff.

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): For small things, Flask is great. I rarely use it for anything that needs more than a single `app.py` file, though.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): First thing I learned. Still the best for big projects (or really anything needing a database and auth).

[Jinja2](https://jinja.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Much as I like Django, Jinja is a better template system.

## CMS

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org): I once told a friend, "If you can make your site work in WordPress, you should use WordPress." I still say that (even when I'd rather code in Python).

## Slideshows (or slide-like presentations)

[Bespoke](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke): Bespoke is the simplest, most modular slide deck framework I've used. It's easy to extend and only does what I want it to. I swapped it in for Swiper on a recent project and it's been great.

## Sound on the web

[Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/): Very simple with lots of nobs and dials, but has its quirks. I could be persuaded to try something else.

## Maps

[Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) for slippy maps. Google is good for navigation but gets in the way of dataviz.
